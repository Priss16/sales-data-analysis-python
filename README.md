# sales-data-analysis-python

## Project Information
**Project Name:** Sales Data Analysis  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Google Colab  
**Repository Purpose:** Academic internship project (Week 2)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how sales data can be analyzed using Python to generate meaningful business insights. A structured dataset was created and processed to understand revenue patterns, product performance, and sales trends over time.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains multiple sales records with the following details:
- Order ID  
- Product name  
- Product category  
- Quantity sold  
- Price per unit  
- Order date  

## Sales Analysis Performed
- Calculated total sales amount for each order using quantity and price  
- Generated an overall sales summary including total revenue and total number of orders  
- Performed product-wise sales analysis to identify top-performing and low-performing products  
- Conducted category-wise sales analysis to understand which categories contribute most to revenue  
- Analyzed monthly sales trends based on order dates to observe demand patterns over time  

## Output and Files
- A Google Colab notebook containing the complete data analysis and calculations  
- An exported CSV file (`week2_sales_analysis_output.csv`) with the final processed dataset  

## Conclusion
This project highlights practical data analysis skills using Python and Pandas, and shows how raw sales data can be transformed into useful information for business decision-making.
